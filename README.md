SSITH-FETT-Voting
===

This repository contains the voting-related application - a _voter
registration system_ - of the SSITH FETT bug bounty exercise, which is
also the voting-related application that will later be adapted to
demonstrations at Black Hat and the ERI Summit.

The high-level requirements for the BESSPIN Voter Registration System are
in [requirements.md](requirements.md). The system design is in 
the [design](design) directory.
